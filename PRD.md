# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **Project Name**: Collectr  
> **Description**: A web app to manage, organize, and track a personal collection of physical video games across platforms.

---

## 1. Overview

**Collectr** is a tool for gamers, collectors, and hobbyists to track and manage their physical game libraries. Users will be able to catalog games, mark ownership status, note condition, add metadata like release year, and optionally upload cover art.

The MVP will provide core CRUD functionality and basic browsing of the collection via a clean, performant web UI.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

### Goals

- Allow users to **create, read, update, and delete** game entries.
- Support **searching, filtering, and sorting** by platform, title, and ownership status.
- Enable users to optionally **upload cover art** per game.
- Provide a clean, fast, responsive UX built on **React** and managed via **NX** for future scalability.

### Success Metrics

- âœ… MVP functional requirements met
- ðŸ§ª Internal collection size > 100 games without performance issues
- ðŸ“ˆ App loads under 1s on modern browsers (Lighthouse score > 90)
- ðŸ§  Developer productivity and testability proven via modular NX structure

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- User authentication / accounts (MVP will use local storage or static data)
- Cloud sync or cross-device access
- Mobile-native apps (PWA may be considered in later phase)
- Barcode scanning or image recognition
- Public sharing / social features
- Metadata auto-fetch from external APIs (e.g., IGDB, GiantBomb)
