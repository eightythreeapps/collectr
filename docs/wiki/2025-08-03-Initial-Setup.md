## üèÅ Starting State
**What was the state of the project at the start?**
- Empty project with only PRD document
- No code infrastructure
- No Firebase project
- No development environment

## üìù Work Log

### 10:00 - Project Foundation Setup
**What was done:**
- Created monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- Set up `/apps`, `/packages`, `/infrastructure`, `/firebase` directories
- Configured TypeScript with strict settings across all packages
- Created shared types package with Zod schemas

**Code Changes:**
```bash
mkdir -p apps/{web,api,workers} packages/{types,eslint-config} infrastructure/terraform firebase
pnpm init
```

**Key Files Created:**
- `package.json` (root workspace config)
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- `packages/types/src/{game,shelf,user,api}.ts` (Zod schemas)

### 11:00 - Next.js Web App Setup
**What was done:**
- Scaffolded Next.js 14 with App Router
- Configured Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- Set up Firebase SDK integration
- Created responsive landing page

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/firebase.ts - Firebase configuration
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const storage = getStorage(app);
```

### 12:00 - Fastify API Server
**What was done:**
- Created Fastify server with TypeScript
- Implemented Firebase Admin SDK integration
- Built authentication middleware with public/private route handling
- Created route stubs for games, shelves, users

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts
const PUBLIC_ROUTES = ['/health', '/v1/games/search'];
```

### 13:00 - Firebase Project Setup
**What was done:**
- Created Firebase project `collectr-8ae95`
- Enabled Firestore, Storage, Authentication, Hosting
- Deployed security rules with deny-by-default posture
- Configured Firestore indexes for optimal queries

**Code Changes:**
```bash
firebase use collectr-8ae95
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules,firestore:indexes
```

### 14:00 - IGDB API Integration
**What was done:**
- Registered Twitch application for IGDB access
- Implemented IGDBService with OAuth token management
- Added RAWG API fallback service
- Created intelligent game search with relevance scoring
- Fixed authentication middleware URL parsing issue

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Game search working with real IGDB data
curl "http://localhost:3001/v1/games/search?q=mario"
// Returns: Nintendo games with cover art, descriptions, metadata
```

### 15:00 - Deployment to Firebase Hosting
**What was done:**
- Configured Next.js for static export
- Built and deployed web application
- Resolved Firebase hosting configuration issues
- Successfully deployed to https://collectr-8ae95.web.app

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
};
```

## ‚úÖ Achievements
- [x] **Monorepo Foundation**: Fully working TypeScript monorepo with pnpm
- [x] **Firebase Integration**: Complete backend setup with security rules
- [x] **Local Development**: Working dev environment with hot reload
- [x] **Game Search API**: Real IGDB data integration working perfectly
- [x] **Web Deployment**: Live application on Firebase Hosting
- [x] **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Zod validation

## üöÄ Deployments
- **Local**: ‚úÖ API server on :3001, Web app on :3000, Firebase emulators on :4000
- **Production**: ‚úÖ https://collectr-8ae95.web.app (live and responding)

## üêõ Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: ESLint Version Conflicts
**Problem**: TypeScript ESLint parser incompatible with ESLint v9
**Solution**: Updated to @typescript-eslint v8 and relaxed strictOptionalPropertyTypes
**Prevention**: Pin dependency versions in shared ESLint config

### Issue 2: Firebase Admin Initialization Timing
**Problem**: Firebase services accessed before initialization
**Solution**: Moved service exports inside initializeFirebase function
**Prevention**: Always initialize services after app setup

### Issue 3: Authentication Middleware URL Parsing
**Problem**: Query parameters in URL prevented public route matching
**Solution**: Parse pathname separately from full URL
**Prevention**: Always test route matching with query parameters

### Issue 4: Next.js Static Export Configuration
**Problem**: Default Next.js build doesn't create exportable static files
**Solution**: Added `output: 'export'` to next.config.js
**Prevention**: Configure static export from the beginning for hosting deployments

## üß† Learnings & Insights
- **Monorepo Benefits**: Shared types across frontend/backend eliminated many integration issues
- **Firebase Security**: Deny-by-default rules with explicit allow patterns provide robust security
- **IGDB API**: Requires server-to-server OAuth flow, not redirect-based authentication
- **Development Workflow**: Having working local environment before production deployment saves time
- **Type Safety**: Zod schemas provide runtime validation + TypeScript types from single source

## üìã Next Session TODOs
- [ ] **Authentication UI**: Build Google/Apple sign-in components
- [ ] **Game Search Interface**: Create search UI connected to working API
- [ ] **Collection Management**: Implement "Add to Shelf" functionality
- [ ] **User Profiles**: Build user account and shelf management
- [ ] **Cloud Run Deployment**: Deploy API server to production
- [ ] **Custom Domain**: Set up collectr.app domain
