# 2025-08-17: Authentication UI Implementation

## üìÖ Session Info
- **Date**: 2025-08-17
- **Duration**: Started at 16:35
- **Developer(s)**: Claude Code AI Assistant
- **Session Type**: Development

## üéØ Goals
- [ ] Implement user authentication system (login/register UI)
- [ ] Create Firebase Auth integration with React components
- [ ] Add protected routes and auth context
- [ ] Design responsive login/register forms
- [ ] Add Google OAuth integration per PRD requirements

## üèÅ Starting State
**What was the state of the project at the start?**
- Firebase Auth already configured on both frontend and backend
- Basic project structure with Next.js app and Fastify API
- Auth middleware exists on API side for protected routes
- No UI components for authentication yet
- Environment setup complete with emulators
- PRD specifies email/password + Google OAuth required

## üìù Work Log

### 16:35 - 17:40 - Authentication System Implementation
**What was done:**
- Created AuthContext with Firebase Auth integration
- Implemented LoginForm and RegisterForm components with email/password + Google OAuth
- Created AuthModal component for modal authentication flows
- Added Header component with user menu and authentication buttons
- Updated layout.tsx to include AuthProvider and Header
- Modified home page to show different content for authenticated vs guest users

**Outcome:**
- Authentication UI components successfully created
- Web application running on http://localhost:3001 (port 3000 conflict)
- API server running on http://localhost:3001
- Firebase emulators not running (Java dependency issue)
- Basic authentication flow implemented and ready for testing

**Code Changes:**
```bash
# Main files created/modified:
- apps/web/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx (new)
- apps/web/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx (new)
- apps/web/src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx (new)
- apps/web/src/components/auth/AuthModal.tsx (new)
- apps/web/src/components/layout/Header.tsx (new)
- apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx (modified)
- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx (modified)
```

```typescript
// Key features implemented:
- Email/password authentication
- Google OAuth integration
- User state management with React Context
- Protected routes capability
- Responsive modal system
- Error handling and loading states
```

### 17:40 - 17:45 - Firebase Emulator Setup Fix
**What was done:**
- Diagnosed Java connectivity issue preventing Firebase emulators from starting
- Set proper JAVA_HOME environment to point to homebrew openjdk@11 installation
- Successfully started Firebase emulators with all services running
- Verified emulator endpoints are accessible

**Outcome:**
- Firebase Auth emulator running on 127.0.0.1:9099 ‚úÖ
- Firestore emulator running on 127.0.0.1:8080 ‚úÖ
- Storage emulator running on 127.0.0.1:9199 ‚úÖ
- Firebase UI available at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ ‚úÖ
- Google OAuth authentication should now work properly

**Code Changes:**
```bash
# Fixed Java environment for Firebase emulators:
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
firebase emulators:start --project=demo-collectr
```

### 17:45 - 17:55 - Fixing Google OAuth Emulator Issues
**What was done:**
- Investigated Google OAuth popup/postMessage error with Firebase Auth emulator
- Added fallback mechanism: popup ‚Üí redirect for development environment
- Enhanced Google OAuth provider configuration with proper scopes
- Added redirect result handling for OAuth flows
- Improved error logging and debugging information

**Outcome:**
- Google OAuth authentication working with Firebase Auth emulator
- Fallback mechanisms in place for different authentication scenarios
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Ready for final testing of authentication flows

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Enhanced Google OAuth with emulator support:
- Added signInWithRedirect as fallback
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added redirect result processing
- Custom parameters for emulator environment
```
